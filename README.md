## Tech Stacks: 
* __React__:  React Components can be reused, combined and nested to the main content, which boosts front-end development       productivity.(so that in this app, for website display and Mobile display, I can use the same code and structure)  
* __Node.js__,Webpack: use Node.js and Webpack to manage big code base and all the dependencies
* __Responsive__: App displayed well on both PC and Mobile(Iphone 6)
* __Ant Design__: use Ant Design framework(similar to bootstrap) to give this app a basic css styling so that I can focus on wiritng logical code not worry too much about the styling
* __APIs__: chinese version buzzfeed and ABC News, to-do: use The New York Times API for more content 
* __ES6 & JSX__
